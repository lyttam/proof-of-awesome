						<h3>Collaboration</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								I value input from others and team consensus, especially when it comes to high-level decisions. 
								As a member of a small agile team working to convert legacy JavaScript into reusable React components, 
								I had daily conversations with my colleagues about architecture and code style that helped the transition 
								go smoothly and ensured everyone was on the same page during the process.

						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								While I take pride in my written communication skills, nothing beats face-to-face interactions between team members. 
								In my role as a technical lead on a project with the majority of the team working from different remote locations, 
								I arranged daily video chats as well as in-person meetings whenever feasible. As a result, productivity and team morale were vastly improved.

						<h3>Mediation</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								At work and in my personal life, I often find myself helping people from different backgrounds to understand each other better. 
								I used my knowledge of both client and server-side technologies to bridge a gap between front-end and back-end developers on a project, 
								helping each side to understand the other’s perspective and needs in order to get the job done efficiently and effectively.

						<h3>Listening</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								My rule of thumb when engaging with others is to do 30% talking and 70% active listening. 
								I’m good at asking the right questions to make others feel comfortable opening up about themselves.

						<h3>Mentoring</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								I started mentoring at an early age:  volunteering at a summer camp teaching survival skills to Girl Scouts, working at the YMCA as a swimming instructor, 
								and teaching music lessons to kids. Those experiences laid the foundation for my successful on-the-job role as mentor for a summer intern, 
								as well as constant two-way knowledge sharing with my peers.

						<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
						<i class="closed icon-folder-empty"></i>
						<i class="open icon-folder-open-empty">
							<div>
								The same methods I use to develop technical solutions are useful in personal situations as well. I’m level-headed and logical in the face of a challenge, 
								able to see multiple sides of almost any conflict, and can outline rational arguments to help determine the best alternative.
