					<h3>InfoSec Institute, Application Developer</h3> Madison, WI (May 2015 - April 2016)
					<p>I worked with a small agile team doing rapid development on a LAMP stack application that provides peer assessment and practice questions for I.T. professionals studying for certification exams. Upon joining the team I quickly familiarized myself with PHP, having no prior experience, and began contributing immediately as a front-end/back-end developer. In a short time I helped migrate the user interface from static server-rendered pages to highly reusable and modular React components, introduced e-commerce and implemented a paywall around key features, and mentored and pair-programmed with colleagues to increase knowledge across all layers of the application.

					<h3>Great Lakes Higher Education Corp., Senior Programmer/Analyst</h3> Madison, WI (May 2008 - May 2015)
					<p>As a technical lead on a development team, I performed thorough analysis and developed quality, maintainable software with special attention to performance, security, and ADA/usability standards.  I provided direction on architecture and coding decisions, mentored new developers, managed tasks and timelines, and introduced new tools and technologies.  I helped build and deliver a highly complex one-page web interface that enabled our call center staff to provide excellent, consistent customer service. I honed my technical and personal skills on a variety of other projects including external-facing websites and reporting applications.

					<h3>Wisconsin Department of Corrections, Intern</h3>  Madison, WI (May 2007 - August 2007)

					<h3>Anne Lyttle, Music Instructor</h3>  Marion, IA (September 2002 - August 2004)
